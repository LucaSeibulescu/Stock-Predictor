# Stock-Predictor

A simple stock predictor python notebook. The notebook uses an LSTM model that takes 50 days of trading data for a certain stock as input and predicts the 51st dayâ€™s price. It currently uses 6 features per trading day as input: open price, high, low, closing price, and volume for the stock.
